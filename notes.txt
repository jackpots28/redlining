## Splitting full sentence into fragments of 'n_number_words' size and returning a new list of fragment phrases
sentence = "Some number of words in length sentence."
spit_sentence = sentence.split()
n_number_words: int = 2
n_split_sentence: list = [' '.join(split_sentence[i:i+n_number_words]) for i in range(0,len(split_sentence), n_number_words]

### Break on '.' then iterate over a variable 'n' for breaking sentence into sub-phrases

"""
Assumptions:

.) list of len(n) "phrases"
.) break "paragraph" on sentence - e.g. '.'
    - the idea is, the known phrases won't overlap sentence length - thus will only be found per sentence
.) based on len(list(sentences)[x]) iter over broken paragraphs in contexts windows of len(list(sentences)[x]) +/- [0..3]
    - create embeddings per each permutation of above
